# 🐾 Bobcat Population Dynamics Research

A mathematical modeling project analyzing bobcat population trends and sustainability through age-structured simulations.

## 📘 Overview

This project investigates the population dynamics of bobcats using **age-structured matrix models**. By simulating ecological scenarios in **R**, we assess the impact of environmental and human factors on long-term population stability. The goal is to inform conservation strategies through data-driven modeling.

## 🔍 Objectives

- Model bobcat populations across different age classes using matrix population models  
- Analyze survival rates, reproduction patterns, and hunting pressure  
- Run simulations to predict future population trends under various scenarios  
- Evaluate the impact of conservation policies or ecological changes

## 🧠 Key Features

- **Age-structured modeling** using Leslie matrices  
- **Scenario analysis** for natural vs. human-influenced environments  
- **Data-driven simulations** and visual outputs to guide interpretation  
- Written in **R**, using packages such as `ggplot2`, `matrixStats`, and `dplyr`
